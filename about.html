        <h2 class="colorchange">Reannouncing NVIDIA-SKNCOE-2020 official club<br></h2>
    <div class=inside-section> 
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>     
        <p>The club conducted by our team of IT department and in collaboration ZeroGravity club. All is about collaboration, learning, and growing
            the community by helding webinars, workshops, etc.We are trying reaching outnand combining growing people together.
            The NVIDIA-SKNCOE 2020 program includes a mixture of keynotes,panel discussions, 100+ sessions, and deep learning, and traning in AI 
            ,deep  learning and GPU-programming with experts. <br>
            NVIDIA'S Invention of the GPU In 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, 
            and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited 
            modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots, and 
            self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.<br>For self learners and small teams,we recommend self-paced, 
            online training through DLI and online courses through or partners. With DLI, you'll have a access to a fully configured, GPU-accelerated
            server in the cloud, gain practical skills for your work. <br>
        </p><br>

        
        <h3>INSIDE</h3>
        <p>Training you to Solve The World's Most Challenging Problems.<br>We offer hands-on exercise training on AI, computing, and accelerated data science ans also earn a certificate in it.
            Club is under Nvidia-DLI hence we provided live sessions or all day workshop with experts(only available in english).
            As beacause training sessions aur taught by a live instructor and we want to ensure proper teacher-to-student ratios, 
            capacity is limited. Traning sessions will not be reecorded or made available for later viewing. <br>Classes fill up quickely so register 
            and sign up early to reserve spot of your. we are available on social platforms. Visit @home page to follow us on social media. <br> Trainer expects 
            only basic needs from students and partricipents we have provided the Event's details including with the Prerequisites,Technologies And date&time below imside the WORKSHOP'S 
            HEADLINE SECTION go through it.<br><br> We offers Events in Two formats:<br><br>INSTRUCTOR-WORKSHOPS <br>Workshops teaches you
            how to implement and deploy end-to-end project inone day. Offered via a virtual classrooms at customer sites, conferences and universities, full day 
            workshops include hands-on training and lectures.Workshops offered a certificate of competency upon completion of the built-in assessment. <br>
            <br>ONLINE(WEBINARS)<br>ONLINE,self-paced courses show you how to set up an end-to-end project in few of hours.Webinars can be taken anywhere--as long as you have
            a laptop and internet connection. <br>
